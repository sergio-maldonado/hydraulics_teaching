# hydraulics_teaching

This repository contains various codes illustrating different principles in environmental hydraulics. The codes are intended for illustrative/pedagogical purposes. A description of each code is provided below.

## dif_lagrangian.m
This Matlab code illustrates the process of diffusion arising from the random motion of individual particles; for example:

</p>

The number of particles and the length of the random walk can be changed. 

A uniform, background velocity field can be prescribed to illustrate the combined effect of advection and diffusion. To make this clear, the trajectory of each particle can be tracked, as shown in the image below.
